<b>About this Exam web-site:</b>
<ul>
<li> the Instructions and the Questions use one browser tab
<li> Notes, Postgresql and C language each have their own tab
<li> the tab will be created the first time you access them
<li> use the tabs to navigate to these once they're open
</ul>
</ul>
<b>General Instructions:</b>
<ul>
<li> Answer <b>all</b> questions.
<li> Questions are not worth equal marks.
<li> Questions may be answered in any order.
<li> Calculator apps (e.g. <tt>bc</tt>, <tt>xcalc</tt>) are available on your workstation.
<li> During the Exam, you must <b>not</b> communicate with other students
<li> Answers to all questions are submitted online
<ul>
<li> for Q1, type your answer into the file <tt>buckets.c</tt> (in the <tt>q1</tt> directory)
<li> for Q2..Q8, type your answer into the file with <tt>.txt</tt> suffix (e.g. <tt>q2.txt</tt>)
<li> submit your answers using the <tt>give</tt> command

<li> Any answers submitted after 11:59pm AEST will be ignored
</ul>
<p>
If you believe that insufficient information has been provided to answer <br>
a given question, then you should write any assumptions that you think are <br>
necessary to complete the question and continue work from there. If the <br>
assumptions are reasonable, you can still obtain full marks for the question.
</p>
<p>
Note that marks are awarded for primarily for working, not just for getting <br>
the correct final answer. If you get an incorrect final answer in one part of<br>
a question and use it in a later part of that question, it is still possible <br>
to achieve full marks for the later part if all working is correct.
</p>
<p>
For the programming question, you can only receive full marks for a <br>
correctly-working program that compiles with no warnings. In all other <br>
cases, you receive partial-marks based on how close the program <br>
is to being correct. Submitting an unchanged <tt>buckets.c</tt> is worth zero marks.
