a.

There are 2 nodes in the quad-tree.

b.

For this query, A > 40 and B < 'f', 
At level 1 we examine NW, NE
For NW -> data page but no matching tuples
For NE we examine NE-NW, NE-NE, NE-SW, NE-SE
    NE-NW -> data page containing 1 matching tuple
    NE-NE -> data page containing 2 matching tuples
    NE-SW -> data page containing 1 matching tuple
    NE-SE -> data page no matching tuples

So, quadrants NW, NE and sub-quadrants NE-NW, NE-NE, NE-SW, NE-SE need to be examined.

c.

According to part b, 4 tuples would be in the result set.
