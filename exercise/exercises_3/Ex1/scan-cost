Analysis of cost of scanning a file
and storing results in another file
Assuming no indexes on the "x" attribute

#tuples = r = 10,000
#bytes/tuple = R = 200
#bytes/page = B = 4096
#tuples/page = c = floor(B/R) = 20
#pages = ceil(r/c) = 500

time to read a page = 10msec
time to check one tuple = 1 usec
time to form one result tuple = 1 usec

Time cost for: select * from R where x > 10;

#pages read = b = 500
time to read pages = 500 * 10ms

cost to check all tuples = 10ms

#tuples in result = 5000
                    (50% of tuples satisfy where clause)

mktuple cost = 5ms

#pages written = ceil(5000/20) = 250
time to write pages = 250 * 10ms

Total time
= reading + checking + making + writing
= ?
= ?
