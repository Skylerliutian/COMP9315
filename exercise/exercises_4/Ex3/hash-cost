Assume that k is primary key

Search process for

	select * from R where k = 51;

h = hash(51);
p = get_page(R,h);
for each tuple t in page p {
	if (t.k = 51) found match
}
for each overflow page ov of p {
	for each tuple t in page ov {
		if (t.k = 51) found match
	}
}

Best case = 1
Worst case = 1 + length-of-longest-overflow-chain
Average case = 1 + average-overflow-chain-length/2



search process for

	select * from R where k > 50;

Hashing does not help; need to read everything

All cases = b + b_Ov
