How big is a FieldDesc?

8KB pages

FieldDesc values could be 64 bits = 8 bytes

Offsets
=======

max offset = 8KB-1

number of bits to represent all offsets = 13  (2^13=8K)


Lengths
=======

number of bits for length = 11  (max length 2^11=2K)

for large variable length attrs = store rid = 32 bits


Types
=====

store oid of pg_type tuple
