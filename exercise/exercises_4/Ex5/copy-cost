heap -> heap
- scan input page-by-page, write to output
- maybe some reduction in size if input had gaps

b_in + b_out, where b_out <= b_in


sorted -> heap
- same as above

b_in + b_out, where b_out <= b_in


heap -> sorted
- two possibilities:
  (1) maintain order on each insert
  (2) make a simple copy as above and then Sort

b_in + r_in*Cost(insert)   (1)

b_in + b_out + Cost(sort(infile)) + b_out    (2)
