First, we assume that you've loaded pizza.dump
Second, you will not see the same oid's in your database

The following two queries will give you the oid's

pizza=# select oid, datname from pg_database where datname='pizza';
  oid  | datname 
-------+---------
 16473 | pizza
(1 row)

pizza=# select oid, relname from pg_class where relname in ('pizzas','people');
  oid  | relname 
-------+---------
 16480 | people
 16483 | pizzas
(2 rows)

I can find the data files in /srvr/jas/pgsql/data/base/16473

The data file for Pizzas is 16483
The command "ls -l 16483" gives
-rw------- 1 jas jas 8192 Jun 11 12:06 16480
The command "strings 16483" gives the names of some pizza types, e.g.
Beef Mia
Pepperoni Mia
Chicken Mia
Margherita
...

The data file for People is 16480
The command "ls -l 16480" gives
-rw------- 1 jas jas 73728 Jun 11 12:06 16480
The command "strings 16480" gives the names of some people, e.g.
Andrew
	Pak
Alex
Vicki
StewartO
Daniel
Jason

You won't necessarily see the strings in exactly the same order.


The sizes of the files have something in common. What is it?
(apart from the file update time)
There is another file for People called 16480_fsm. What is this?
